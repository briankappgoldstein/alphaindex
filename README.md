# alphaindex
Very Tiny WordPress Plugin that lets you create an Alphabetical Index of posts (or custom posts)

1) Download the .zip and upload to WordPress via the plugin installer or extract the folder and install manually. 
2) configure the plugin in the index file. All you need to do is: 

change the variable $slug to whatever your custom post type is called, i.e.  'portfolio', 'people', etc. 
if desired, change 'show_ui' from false to true.  This will show it in the WP backend for the post type you set. 

That's it!  Once you've installed it, all you have to do is use the taxonomy 'alpha' wherever you need an alphabatized list in your templates.
